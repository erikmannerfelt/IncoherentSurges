# Code for Mannerfelt et al., (2025): Tracking glacier surge evolution using interferometric SAR coherence â€” examples from Svalbard

This repo contains code to download InSAR coherence data from ASF Vertex, and tools for plotting / analyzing manual low-coherence front measurements.
The main files are `query_insar.py` (run it directly to start querying all Sentinel-1 InSAR scenes) and `surge_propagation.py` for all plotting/statistics functions.
